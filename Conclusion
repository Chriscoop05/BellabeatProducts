## Suggestions for watch

1. Set fitness goals with nudges (notifications, promotions, advertisements) for our customers matching the distribution of daily activity metrics overseen above
    
    * Set monthly goals to reach 100,000 steps, 100km - 200km, and to minimize sedentary minutes under 20,000 minutes 
    
    * Set daily goals to build participants up to walking at least 5 - 7 km per day and to walk 7500 steps per day. Base this information on modeling based off BMI, weight, and other physical baseline health information that should be gathered about consenting customers.
    
    * Have the watch set reminders/nudges to minimize sedentary minutes below the daily average of either 700 or 1200.
    
    * Send feedback after each day for how many calories each participant burned from the steps walked - report back weekly BMI/weight pounds. Set goals each month. 
    
    * Slow down fitness notifications from 8pm - 5am and start the day in the morning with the daily goals. 
    
    * During the 12pm - 2pm hours while activity slows down before picking up again, send helpful information about certain health activities that users can read.
    
2. Have the analytics team delve into more insightful metrics to gather more information about our members
    
    * Gather a larger sample of at least 100 participants for this same information and repear the research.
    
    * Get polling information, if the consenting participants agree, on what their weekly agenda is by the hour and day of the week (Partying on the weekends? Work late on Mondays?)
    
    * Expand the research to get 100 participants per season - there tends to be seasonal trends in workout and fitness data that this study did not account for.
    
3. Set Sleep notifications 

    * Because participants have trouble sleeping on the weekends, send notifications each day right before 8pm to get 6-8 hours of sleep. 
    
    * Send weekly feedback posts about how a participant matched their "sleep" goals - did they sleep too little? How many hours of sleep are they missing and when?
    
4. Design a diet plan for each participant 

    * Gather what kind of nutrition our customers are on - for each Id member, nudge them off bad patterns (For example: notify the participant if they have not had a protein all day; if they ate too many fatty items). 
    
    * Send monthly pamphlets/posts with a list of "meals of the month" - keeping each participant's weight down will allow them to take part in more intense activity and a greater volume of distance/steps throughout the day.
    
5. Promotions at the beginning of each month

    * We want to prompt users to use their devices past the beginning of each month more - given that there is a spike at the start and a decline subsequently after. Set promotions such as, "meet your monthly fitness goal and receive 15% off on your next bellabeat purchase!"
    
    * Promotion toward birthdays. Sales if members reach fitness goals a month before their birthday on their next purchase. 
    
    * Holiday promotions at the beginning of each month with big holidays: Beginning of December offer promotions about a buy one get one free deal. The goal is to keep users busy with our products the entire month - not just the beginning. 
    
6. Ease new members into the product gradually 

    * 88% of low usage members tend to use their product all day - perhaps resulting in burnout. Prompt users with easy goals in the beginning and to take breaks after long stretches of time with the item. 
    
    * As time with the device progresses, push more content mentioned above.
