##Metadata Information
The dataset that will be used for this case study was taken from a survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between March 12th, 2016 and May 12th, 2016. Thirty users agreed to daily monitoring of smart device usage, including minute-minute, hour-hour, and daily tracking of personal and health related activities.

##Accessibility and Privacy of data:
This data is open source and waived off by the owner for usage across all platforms globally. All data can be replicated, distributed, and processed freely.
###Data Integrity:
The sample size of 30 users in this case study is not sufficient to make absolute claims. More research with a bigger sample size varied by geographic location and demographic is suggested in order to gauge a better conclusion on the smart device habits of users. Additionally, the data is not very current or relevant to the time frame today. A decade old data set may lead to obsolete findings that other tech companies might have solved through newer technology.
Units
Various data sets contain different units carried on by the Fitabase dictionary - a common base of data collection for fitness technology. As the report proceeds, units will be specified per usage of the data.
